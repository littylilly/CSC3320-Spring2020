Lab Assignment 10 - Post-Lab 
Due at 11:59 pm on Friday, April 02, 2021 
Purpose: Learn how to use the pointers to represent strings in C. 
Part 1: 
Write a function about string copy, the strcpy prototype "char* strcpy (char* strDest, const  char* strSrc);". Here strDest is destination string, strSrc is source string. 
1) Write the function strcpy, don't call C string library. 
2) Here strcpy can copy strSrc to strDest, but why we use char* as the return value of strcpy? 
Part 2: 
Write a program findStr.c that finds the "smallest" and "largest" in a series of words. After the  user enters the words, the program will determine which words would come first and last if the  words were listed in dictionary order. The program must stop accepting input when the user enters  a four-letter word. Assume that no word is more than 20 letters long. An interactive session with  the program might look like this: 
Enter word: dog 
Enter word: zebra 
Enter word: rabbit 
Enter word: catfish 
Enter word: walrus 
Enter word: cat 
Enter word: fish 
Smallest word: cat 
Largest word: zebra 
Hint: Use two strings named smallest_word and largest_word to keep track of the "smallest" and  "largest" words entered so far. Each time the user enters a new word, use strcmp to compare it with  smallest_word; if the new word is "smaller", use strcpy to save it in smallest_word. Do a similar comparison with largest_word. Use strlen to determine when the user has entered a four-letter  word. 
Questions: 
1) Attach the source code of your C program into the answer sheet. 
2) Run the C program, attach a screenshot of the output in the answer sheet. 1
